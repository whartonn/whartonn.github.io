### Coding / Tech
- **DON'T** use networksolutions.com as a domain registrar: dark patterns abound(!)
  -  3 unnecessary days to get an authorization code emailed to transfer a domain to another registrar.
  -  5-7 additional unnecessary days to wait for confirmation of a transfer after the authorization code was processed by the registrar.

### Kubernetes/ Containers
- K8s "simplified" docs (open source project): [https://kubespec.dev](https://kubespec.dev)
- WASM containers can theoretically start faster than distro-less Docker containers (no user-space OS setup), maybe making them useful for serverless apps. Security is uncertain. Compilation to WASM perhaps a pain. A technology to watch, at least.
- Docker on an Intel Mac runs a Linux VM (LinuxKit) with just the kernel (for x86_64-based containers). Only userspace goes in a container.
- Docker on an M1+ Mac, uses QEMU for virtualization of x86_64 containers (slower ðŸ˜¢).
