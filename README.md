### Kubernetes/ Containers
- K8s "simplified" docs (open source project): [https://kubespec.dev](https://kubespec.dev)
- WASM containers can theoretically start even faster than distro-less Docker containers (no user-space OS setup), theoretically/maybe making them useful for serverless apps. Possibly more secure (maybe not((?)). Compilation to WASM and inclusion of e.g.: Prometheus, etc could be tricky, though. A technology to watch, at least.
- Docker on an Intel Mac runs a Linux VM ( LinuxKit) with just the kernel (for x86_64-based containers. Only userspace goes in a container.
- Docker on an M1+ Mac, uses Rosetta 2 / QEMU for virtualization of x86_64 containers (slower ðŸ˜¢).
